## My process
I used flexbox to building this card and continue on my journey of advancing my SCSS and GitHub skills.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

Working with GitHub has taught me a bit more about absolute vs. relative paths. So these challenges are truly great learning tools. And of course practice makes perfect. Although my finally design css is simple flexbox code, I actually took sometime and tried a lot of different flexbox properties to see how they worked, i.e., like flex-grow. Flex grow can actually work better than defining width, especially when you want a site to be responsive across all browsers.


### Continued development

There are two more challenges to go in the beginner learning path. As much as I want to move on to more challenging challenges. 

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - W3 School has been instrumental in learning the many properties of flexbox and provides a place to test what you learn. Not the most indept learning experiencing, but great at simlifying and teaching the basics of frontend web development.
- [Learn Sass](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-sass/) - FreeCode Camp has a wonderful Beginner's Guide to Sass that I found very useful and still refer to from time to time.
